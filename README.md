# Nightshade

Nightshade is named after the family of plants that includes the tomato, or "pomodoro" in Italian, because it is a task tracking app that works well with the Pomodoro Technique time management method. For each day, it allows the user to log the number of pomodoros (25-minute work intervals) completed. This web application currently saves these locally to the user's browser with the Web Storage API.
